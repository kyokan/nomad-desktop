## nomad-ui 

**Nomad** is a peer-to-peer, ownerless social network built on top of [Handshake](https://github.com/handshake-org) and [Footnote](https://github.com/kyokan/footnote). It allows you to view and interact with content from owners of Handshake names.

## Getting Started

Desktop: [Release](https://github.com/nomad-org/nomad-ui/releases)

## Features

#### Protection

Nomad is your own space (a profile, plus file space that belongs to you). That means no one on earth has the power to remove you from this network.
 
#### Freedom

Nomad is a space where the whole world can talk, listen, and think freely. We give you full power to make your own content filters and form your own opinions online.

#### Identity

Your identity is simply your personal domain name on Handshake, a peer-to-peer naming system. You can take this identity with you anywhere Handshake domains are used.
